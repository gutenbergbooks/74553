<p>Lawyers are supposed to be more
interested in the past than in the
future and to resent lay criticism. Yet
most lawyers would find the contemplation
of existing anomalies intolerable
if there were no prospect of any
future remedy, and so far as lay
criticism is concerned, it is almost invariably
the lawyers who want reforms
and are hopelessly obstructed by
stupidity and indolence in the House
of Commons. If the laity were really
interested in legal reform the world
would be a happier place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span></p>

<p>In the last twenty years I have
come across a large number of judges,
barristers, and solicitors who have
spent endless time and trouble in trying
to improve our marriage and divorce
laws without receiving any aid or
gratitude from the public, and even
an incomparable jurist and versatile
scholar like Sir Frederick Pollock has
never spared any effort to remove
hardship with which he may not have
been brought so closely in contact as
less learned men.</p>

<p>I mention all this because my motive
in writing the following remarks is to
stimulate the interest of the laity in the
law. The law offers a fine intellectual
discipline and moral training to
its students. Its standard of honesty
is far higher than the ordinary commercial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
standard and it teaches men
and women how to think, as distinct
from cramming miscellaneous facts
into their heads without any guiding
principle. Medieval men and women
who had any education at all were far
better educated than the newspaper
reader of to-day. They were often
bilingual and usually understood
theology, if not law, and therefore
comprehended logic and the rules of
reasoning far better than the ordinary
voter of our own time.</p>

<p>Professor Jowett once said that logic
was “neither a science nor an art but a
dodge,” and that is rather the attitude
of the man in the street to law. I hope
that any reader of this book who may
be induced to look into some of the
points I have mentioned will feel this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
attitude to be as Philistine and unworthy
as Jowett’s other observation
that “<span lang="fr">Ici on parle français</span>” was the
real inscription over the gates of Hell.</p>

<p>The title of this book connotes limitation,
for it is obviously impossible to
attempt a prophecy about law in all
parts of the world, even though
“prophecy is the most gratuitous form
of error.” I shall confine myself in
the main to law in English-speaking
countries, for the countries which have
adopted Roman Law—<i>i.e.</i>, Scotland
and most European countries—are not
likely to change it very much. English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
law has largely influenced the world
through English Colonies and even
through South America, where Bentham
drafted more than one constitution.
Bacon drafted the constitution of
Virginia, which has been the model of
the average American State. Even the
present writer has been unofficially
consulted about a Federal divorce law
for the United States.</p>

<p>The future of law in every State
depends very much on political developments.
If democracy proceeds
on its present lines all law is likely to
be brought into contempt. Law is
brought into contempt in many ways
but usually as follows:—</p>

<p>(1) Bad drafting of statutes as in
the case of the Rent Restriction Acts,
the ambiguity of which necessitates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
incessant litigation and conflicting
decisions.</p>

<p>(2) Absence of principle or indolence
in applying it. Thus Professor Dicey
wrote:—“English Law might be made
lucid, and would be in the main good,
if we had no statutes. It is not only
or perhaps mainly that Statutes are
ill-drawn ... but that English
judges are incapable of recognizing a
principle when once it is put into the
form of an Act of Parliament.” The
Married Women Property Act of 1882
might have been drawn in two clauses;
the result of this clumsy Statute is that
more than forty years afterwards a
man is held liable for his wife’s torts,
while on the other hand the Partnership
Act, 1890, remains as a model of
lucidity and saves much litigation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>(3) The abuse of legislation by
faddists who try to intrude into matters
which are sacred to the individual.
I need only refer to Prohibition in the
United States as an obvious example
of anarchy created by futile and
hypocritical legislation.</p>

<p>(4) Palpable anomalies such as the
Divorce Law of England and Wales
which embodies a timid compromise
between common sense and theological
doctrines not seriously accepted by 50
per cent. of the community.</p>

<p>(5) Uncertainty and delay, which
have to some extent been remedied for
well-to-do suitors but exist to-day for
most poor persons.</p>

<p>All these tendencies exist to-day
under what is called democracy. In
Canada and the United States we see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
movable property (<i>e.g.</i>, bearer bonds)
taxed on the death of the owner not
in accordance with his domicil but in
accordance with the physical situation
of the property itself. In Victoria
(Australia) the test of residence is substituted
for that of domicil in divorce.
There are also other anomalies resulting
in what is known as “double income
tax.” The operation of the law
is also made uncertain by the Executive
interfering with justice, as appeared
when the first Labour Ministry
in Great Britain jockeyed with the
legal discretion of its own Attorney
General.</p>

<p>There is also a general impatience
with the complexity of human business,
which has to be put into the strait
waistcoat of the law before Justice can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
be achieved, and a tendency to dragoon
citizens when it is easier to employ
force than to determine their rights.
Such tendencies result in Statutes like
the Trades Disputes Act, 1906, and in
setting up bureaucratic bodies like the
Ministry of Health as judges in their
own cause in their own courts.</p>

<p>There are, however, some reassuring
factors to-day. State Socialism is as
dead as a doornail and other forms of
Socialism are not likely to buttress up
bureaucracy. The small investor and
the landowner are waking up to the
advantages of private ownership and
individual enterprise. Objectionable
clauses against liberty in the Wireless
Bill and Criminal Justice Bill have
been hotly opposed. There is also a
better diffusion of educational facilities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
and a perceptible reaction against
what Mr. Belloc calls the “Servile
State.” I shall, therefore, presume to
make my forecast on the assumption
that the world is learning some kind
of wisdom and will in the near future
reform its laws in accordance with
common sense, even if it does not reach
the standard laid down by Dr. Johnson
when he said:—“The Law is the last result
of human wisdom acting on human
experience for the benefit of the public.”</p>

<p>I should, perhaps, claim some indulgence
from lawyers who may think
my remarks unduly sketchy or incomplete.
I am working within a
small compass and writing more for
the layman than for the lawyer. It is
not, therefore, easy to treat my subject
very fully or comprehensively.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I<br>
<small>LEGISLATION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>In all legislation, as in litigation, there
is a struggle between the issue and the
process. The layman wants to simplify
the law, the lawyer wants to simplify
the facts. Anyone who reads the
French code will think French Law
simple; if he hears a French lawsuit
he will find that the code has always
to be interpreted in the light of past
litigation, though French decisions are
not authoritative in the same sense as
ours.</p>

<p>The House of Commons in considering
a bill is often quite as ignorant of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
the subject matter with which it deals
as of the legal antecedents of the Bill.
The ordinary citizen may sometimes
sit on a jury; but he does not
administer the law in rotation as the
Athenian did in the days of Pericles.
Therefore legislation is often retarded
and complicated by appeals to ignorant
prejudice as well as by considerations
of partisan expediency and illogical
compromise. The experts rarely have
the same chance as they had in drafting
the Partnership Act, 1890, which
summarized and boiled down a multitude
of decisions.</p>

<p>Even if Parliament cannot be trusted
to legislate very coherently, there
ought to be a department of State
(<i>e.g.</i>, a Ministry of Justice) engaged
in perpetually clarifying the case law<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
and different statutes of, say, the last
preceding twenty-five years in order to
introduce some coherence and simplicity
into our Statutes. This, however,
will not easily be accomplished unless
the practice of allowing bureaucrats to
draft their own rules and sit in their
own courts as judges in their own
cause be abolished.</p>

<p>Many complaints have been made
against the Common Law of England
owing to the labour of digging up old
cases and reconciling them with the
particular subject matter to which they
are to be applied; but the legal tangles
of our time are worse than the old
and are mainly due to the difficulty
of interpreting statutes which are
obscurely drafted and ambiguously
worded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>If these statutes often puzzle the
judges who have to administer them
it is not fair to the layman to say to
him:—“<i lang="la">Ignorantia legis neminem
excusat.</i>” It may, therefore, be fairly
presumed that future Parliaments will
employ the most expert draftsmen
they can find to eliminate all the
defects that now import chaos, and
therefore hardship and expense, into
the community.</p>

<small>THE LAW COURTS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I shall not deal fully with the Law
Courts as such in this chapter but only
with the obvious tendencies of our
day towards the decentralization and
specialization of justice. It is said
that justice must be brought to the
poor man’s door; therefore the County
Courts should have divorce jurisdiction
in addition to other powers.
Judges should sometimes have more
than a general knowledge of the subject
matter which comes before them;
therefore a Commercial Court was set
up in 1895 and a special judge is appointed
to sit in it. Some litigants,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
however, in commercial as well as
other disputes prefer to appoint expert
arbitrators who rely for legal guidance
on their personal experience of law
and on the eminent counsel practising
before them. Supporters of this movement
towards specialization quote with
approval the very fair decisions of
Courts Martial or the Law Society’s
Discipline Committee, while pointing
out the comical blunders of the Chancery
division judges when they were
sent on circuit shortly after the Judicature
Act of 1873.</p>

<p>The Commercial Court has certainly
done very good work in its thirty years
of existence. It helps on the assimilation
of laws in different countries on
such subjects as bills of exchange, and
it would be more important if there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
were more trade and if the practising
Counsel’s clerks demanded less enormous
fees. These two drawbacks
should surely be remedied in the
future and this Court is not likely to
be replaced by any big international
court working on Admiralty lines.</p>

<p>The Admiralty Court has acquired
remarkable prestige because nowadays
foreigners more and more often refer
marine disputes by consent to its jurisdiction,
and it looks as if the Admiralty
Law of England might soon
spread all over the world like the
Roman <cite lang="la">Jus Gentium</cite>. Even the Germans
handsomely acknowledge the
scrupulous equity of the English Courts
as between a British subject and alien.</p>

<p>How far divorce work can be properly
specialized I shall discuss in a later<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
chapter. The trend of present opinion
is to resent the limitation of matrimonial
causes to special judges because</p>

<p>(1) This principle of limitation is
rooted in the old idea that only ecclesiastical
lawyers can properly deal with
the institution of marriage and</p>

<p>(2) The admission of the principle
is the main obstacle to the decentralization
of divorce.</p>

<p>The ordinary Englishman still has
the Athenian ideal of public duties
being performed by ordinary citizens
in rotation. He likes trial by jury and
looks kindly on the patriotic efforts of
an unpaid Magistracy. The work of
the expert and professional is often
unexpectedly illuminated by the criticism
of the amateur. The liberal humanism
of the first Lord Gorell, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Lord Birkenhead, and of Mr. Justice
Swift—to name only three men of
Liverpool—has blown away many
ancient quasi-ecclesiastical cobwebs of
the Divorce Court. The ancient wisdom
of the Common Law has often
efficiently protected the liberties of
Great Britain from the tyranny of
king, baron, and bureaucrat.</p>

<p>The same revolt against what is conceived
to be legal pedantry emerges in
the undiscriminating support that Lord
Birkenhead received in carrying the
Law of Real Property Act through
Parliament. But for the hatred of the
Statute of Uses with which he infected
the mind of our legislators, the necessary
reforms could have been made simpler
and better. The probable result will be
the compulsory registration of title to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
land in preference to the less cumbrous
system of Conveyancing inaugurated
in 1882. Much the same conflict
emerges in the controversy whether the
legal profession should remain divided
into barristers and solicitors. I think
that this division will remain because
it corresponds to a real division of
labour; but with this I will deal later.</p>

<p>It is difficult to prophesy how all
these problems will be solved; but it
may fairly be conjectured that justice
of first instance will be more and more
specialized and localized to suit modern
convenience and the obvious needs of
the poor, and that specialization will
not be allowed to stand too much in
the way of decentralization.</p>

<p>In modern times the tyranny of the
group is more oppressive than the
tyranny of the individual and becomes
more and more irresponsible. We all
suffer from the arbitrary powers of
the Trade Union as consolidated by
the Trades Disputes Act, 1906, and of
the limited company as built up by
successive statutes since 1862. The
Trade Union interferes with freedom
of labour and contract, and the limited
company system has fostered, and at
the same time, protectively concealed
the activities of the Trust. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
ordinary member of a Trade Union
has little power of controlling its policy
and the ordinary shareholder would
be surprised to learn that he was entitled
to regard the director of a company
as a trustee for the shareholders.</p>

<p>That a Trade Union should not be
responsible for its torts or that a shareholder
should have but a strictly
limited liability for the enterprise in
which he invests, may appear common
sense to the ordinary mind. Nevertheless
a stable society reposes on the
general responsibility of individual
citizens for their acts. The industrial
conflict of to-day shows some recognition
of all this. There are tendencies
towards giving even the unskilled
workers in joint stock enterprise some
share both of profits and management,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
and this may even extend so far as to
relegate the capitalist to the position
of a debenture holder. Obviously,
however, such a result would weaken
the hold of the Trade Unions in so far
as it promoted peaceful co-operation
between capital and labour, and it
would support the old-fashioned alliance
between English law and individual
liberty. Strikes do not occur
in the legal profession because its position
is established. The Trade Union
of the future may very possibly be no
more obviously militant than the Bar
Council of the Law Society.</p>

<p>The successful working of smaller
enterprises may often be more efficiently
conducted by the machinery of
limited partnership as provided by the
Limited Partnership Act, 1907. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
machinery of the Act has been
neglected by solicitors who are too indolent
to study it and by laymen who
enjoy the pompous verbosity of a
memorandum and articles of association;
but in time to come it should be
extensively adopted.</p>

<p>The State will have to exert eternal
vigilance against the power of private
corporations such as the above; but it
must also control public corporations
and its own departments and again
quasi-public corporations like the Bank
of England. I fancy that the Banks
and big financial trusts will acquire
more and more control of public
policy as well as of private business
and that this trouble will have to get
worse before it gets better.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br>
<small>THE CRIMINAL LAW</small></h2>
</div>


<p>We shall probably see in the near
future some remarkable changes in the
Criminal Law which, particularly in
England, is a peculiar blend of barbaric
violence, medieval prejudices,
and modern fallacies. To-day its sanctions
are still largely theological. For
instance, suicide is a crime in Great
Britain mainly because it is a sin
against God; but there is a growing
tendency to determinism and to regard
crimes and punishments purely in relation
to social welfare. Thus murder
is punished by hanging because it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
a deadly sin; but the public are beginning
to distinguish between murder
by poison and murder by violence in
so far as premeditation enters into the
question.</p>

<p>There is also a disposition to avoid
unnecessary cruelty or insults. If a
man can be sterilized by a surgeon or
standardized by a psycho-analyst, this
solution of the problem will be preferred
to indefinite loss of liberty, and
where indefinite loss of liberty appears
inevitable there is a new sentiment
in favour of painless extinction. The
modern criminal is either to be reformed
by prison or else shut up for
life and given such amenities as beer
and tobacco to console him for loss of
liberty. He used to be looked upon as
possessed by the devil. To-day he is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
regarded as an imperfectly constructed
creature who cannot safely be left at
large if his defects cannot be set right.</p>

<p>This scientific point of view is in
some respects not so human as the
Christian attitude; but it makes for
politeness to the criminal. The younger
judges (<i>e.g.</i>, Mr. Justice Finlay) are
courteous and sympathetic even when
pronouncing sentence of death. The
scolding manner of the old type of
judge will probably disappear in the
next twenty years, and perhaps we shall
one day escape even the intolerable inquisitiveness
and pharisaical insolence
displayed by the less gentlemanly type
of coroner, who presumes on the
anomalous privileges of his venerable
Court to ransack irrelevant details and
censure long-forgotten irregularities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
in the lives and careers of persons sufficiently
unfortunate to be united by
kinship or friendship to suicides and
murderers. Sir Hall Caine recently
made an useful protest on this point.</p>

<p>The famous narrative of the execution
of Socrates by voluntarily taking hemlock
is not very creditable to our modern
civilization. Socrates is surrounded by
his friends and his executioner is civil
and amiable. Socrates feels that this
death is due to a certain blindness on
the part of his fellow-citizens to the importance
of what he has to tell them;
but this collective stupidity does not
diminish his respect for the laws of his
country. He is perfectly willing to
suffer death in order to vindicate laws
which, taken as a whole, are essential
to the public safety. “Father, forgive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
them for they know not what they
do” are words which would have fitted
quite naturally into Plato’s account of
the famous scene. The last utterances
of many criminals have often implied
an acquiescence in the public necessity
of laws which pinch the individual
hardly at certain crises of life.</p>

<p>A man is found guilty of rape if by
persistent effort he has tired the woman
out or weakened her impulse to resist
him. That may seem harsh but is it
any less harsh than to hang a man who
has been mercilessly nagged for an
hour by an uncongenial wife after years
of matrimonial misery aggravated by
the irritant of chronic semi-starvation?
On the other hand, this condemned
criminal may feel that by his death he
is providing a better security for human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
life in time to come, just as, according
to William James, the vivisected
dog might (if properly instructed)
know that he was helping to save both
dog and man from the ravages of incurable
disease.</p>

<p>It may be hoped that crime may be
reduced by legal reforms. The reform
of marriage and divorce laws should
reduce conjugal murder, legitimation
by subsequent marriage should reduce
infanticide, the abolition of really
grinding poverty should reduce all
crimes of violence, and the reform or
repeal of certain laws relating to
offences which concern only adult
individuals and not society at large
should reduce blackmail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V<br>
<small>FAMILY LAW</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Under family law I group marriage,
divorce, guardianship, and inheritance,
and I shall assume, for the purposes of
my forecast, that the family will continue
to exist as an institution and may
even be taken more seriously by the
legislators of the future than by the
legislators of to-day, whose collectivist
bias has taken the form of trying
to abolish every relationship of the individual
except his relationship to the
State as citizen. I am inclined to think
that marriage laws will become more
rational, that legitimation by subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
marriage will become law in
England and Wales as well as in Scotland,
that there will be a law of adoption
as on the Continent, and that there
will be a system of divorce by consent
recognized as such as well as divorce
for matrimonial offences.</p>

<p>There should be no difficulty as to
a law of adoption on Continental lines.
If anyone chooses to adopt a child and
expend toil and money on training and
educating the child, that person should
have some security for quasi-parental
control. If industrial schools are entitled
to disregard parental emotions,
why should not benevolent individuals,
be rewarded for exertions made with
the original consent of the parent?</p>

<p>Legitimation by subsequent marriage
presents no difficulty except as to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
question of adulterine bastardy. At
first sight it seems difficult to allow
legitimation except when the parents of
the bastard were originally capable of
marrying; but considering the shocking
anomalies of divorce in England and
Wales there is a strong case for legitimating
the adulterine bastard when
possible and it has been done in some
British colonies. A compromise may
be reached by limiting the period of
such legitimation to, say, twenty-five
years from the date of the Act.</p>

<p>Any measure of divorce law reform
for England and Wales will merely
bring the country into line with Europe
on the one hand and the Colonies and
the United States on the other. I see
the divorce court of the future in two
departments. The first department<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
will deal with divorces by consent,
protect all parties from rash and heedless
decisions, adjust question of property,
and deal with the problems of
guardianship. I imagine that divorce
by consent will be subject to a time
limit of two or three years, and that
all separations, whether by decree or
by voluntary deed, will mature into
divorces after a certain period of time.
I hope that in the future divorce by
consent will have a time limit as
opposed to the present system under
which there is none.</p>

<p>The second department will deal
with contentious cases in which injury
has been done. The judge will make
every preliminary effort to reconcile
the parties, and the strictest privacy
will be observed, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
Continental custom and to the old
usage of nullity suits in England where
impotence was alleged. The present
system of divorce (which is a sort of
surgical operation) is carried out rather
like a surgical operation without
anæsthetics or aseptic precautions, in
deference to religious prejudice.</p>

<p>As regards the matrimonial offences
for which divorce would be granted,
cruelty and desertion will certainly be
included among them, and probably
imprisonment in the case of criminal
lunatics. If the future development
of the criminal law results in more
permanent detention, then public sentiment
will not be so much opposed as it
is now to the possibility of divorcing
a spouse condemned to a long sentence
of imprisonment. The same attitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
will obviously prevail in regard to the
detention of criminal lunatics, and
probably also all other lunatics where
the disease has been continuous for
five years and is pronounced by experts
to be incurable. But presumably
the lunacy laws will be thoroughly
revised and safeguarded before any
divorce for lunacy becomes possible.</p>

<p>In regard to the financial side of
divorce, it is to be hoped that any
alimony given to an innocent wife may
at least be reducible if she marries a
wealthy man, and that among the poor
the innocent wife will be given a far
better chance of enforcing her claim
for alimony than she is given now.
American practice may profitably be
followed on this point. Whether public
sentiment will continue to approve the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
award of damages to a husband for the
loss of his wife remains to be seen.
This may be justified in some cases, as,
for instance, where the wife supports
the husband or is a rich woman and
her breach of the marriage contract involves
him in pecuniary loss; or where
the children, who in such circumstances
are already prejudiced by losing the
joint care of both parents, are also
likely to lose financial advantages by
reason of their mother marrying another
man. In such a case it does not
seem unfair that the co-respondent
should make some provision for them
if he is in a position to do so.</p>

<p>There remains the question of
guardianship, whether in relation to
marriage or divorce, and there seems
little chance of this being altered, except<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
that possibly a mother, and especially
a mother guilty of adultery,
may have more power in regard to her
children than she has now. Modern
opinion is certainly tending to the view
that the act of adultery is not always
incompatible with maternal love and
efficiency and that an unchaste mother
is at least preferable to a cruel or
mentally deranged mother.</p>

<p>In regard to poor persons, I deal
with the question generally in a later
chapter. But while on the subject of
divorce, I suggest that justice must one
day be brought to the poor man’s door
either through the county court or the
police court or some other court. If
police court separation orders are to
mature into divorces, the police magistrate
is obviously the best person to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
decree a divorce at the end of the
period in question, and possibly he
could even hear defended cases. But
trustworthy observers state that the
police magistrate is often quite unjust
to a husband accused by a wife, either
because he thinks that all wives are in
the right or because the husband is
sulky and verbose. The magistrate
could, of course, do his work very
much better if both parties were
legally represented, and if police court
solicitors ever form a rota to assist
poor persons after the Scottish fashion,
better justice may be done.</p>

<p>I fancy, however, that the problem
may be solved as it is in the United
States, by establishing courts of
domestic relations. Apparently, these
courts do their work at comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
little expense; and this work is by no
means confined to matrimonial disputes.
The judges do, in fact, reconcile
many husbands and wives and adjust
disputes that might otherwise ruin
many homes; but they also step in
to regulate questions of guardianship
in cases where regulation is required.
The lay reader may possibly regard
this as undue interference with the
institution of the family; but any
lawyer acquainted with the beneficent
jurisdiction of the Chancery judges
where minors are concerned, would
naturally wish the poor to have the
same advantages in this respect as the
rich, and I, therefore, imagine that
within fifty years courts of this
description will not only have divorce
jurisdiction but will also have the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
same powers as the Chancery judges
now have over a ward of court. I
shall deal with this question more
fully in a later chapter.</p>

<small>THE LAND LAWS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The abolition of the Statute of Uses
by Lord Birkenhead will be an accomplished
fact on the 1st January, 1926.
Copyhold and other picturesque
tenures of the middle ages are to be
abolished, the law of real property is
to be assimilated to the law of personal
property, women are to be put on an
equality with men as regards the laws
of descent, and primogeniture is to be
abolished. This is all, no doubt, very
sensible, but also depressing for anyone
who likes to feel a certain sense
of continuity with the past. It also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
precipitates the coming conflict between
the Collectivist confiscation of
land and the ideal of small or peasant
proprietorship. The land laws of the
future will, of course, depend on
which party gains the day.</p>

<p>The consistent hostility of all ministries
to agriculture is due to the fact
that Free Trade is now one of the
regular ruts of British finance, and
even the peasant proprietor of France
or Denmark would not flourish without
a certain amount of consideration
from the State. Should the voters of
Great Britain swallow all the nonsense
preached by the followers of Henry
George and Lloyd George in regard to
land monopoly, the ruin of agricultural
prosperity and of the lovely
landscapes of Great Britain may confidently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
be anticipated; but should the
wide distribution of land among smallholders
continue under the <em>ægis</em> of
public favour, we may see the legal
encouragement of freehold tenure on
Canadian or American lines and even
of the tenant being able to buy out his
landlord on fair terms. It is curious
that New Zealand, which adopted
State Socialism on a large scale in the
nineties, is now mainly governed by
individualistic business men and land-owning
farmers.</p>

<p>The big landlords play into the
hands of Collectivists by allowing their
agents to do as they like. I, for instance,
twenty years ago bought a long
lease of a house in St. John’s Wood,
which will expire just when I do not
want to leave my happy home. I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
a delightful garden shaded by poplars
and beeches which will probably be
covered one day by a block of untenanted
flats. I want if possible to
secure my position and am quite ready
to pay any fair price for the freehold
or for an extension of the lease. The
Eyre Estate (my landlord) will not
even condescend to answer a letter of
inquiry, and my experience is by no
means unique. No one is more disposed
to be friendly with big landlords
than I am, for some of them are
profitable clients; but my own experience
of the Eyre Estate impels me and
many others to welcome any law which
will make the tenant less of a worm
in the eyes of his landlord.</p>

<p>The old system of entail and strict
settlement will presumably continue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
for some years with the aid of money
derived from industrial magnates and
American heiresses. The conveyancers
of Lincoln’s Inn may be trusted to
preserve institutions in defiance of
legislation just as they abolished, for
all practical purposes, the right of
dower in the eighteenth century. The
principal question is whether there
will be sufficient money or inclination
to support the old system in order to
prevent places like Chatsworth and
Warwick Castle from being converted
into public schools or lunatic asylums.
If there is, then the lawyers will be
equal to the occasion, and already many
big estates are preserved from destruction
by being turned into limited or
(preferably) unlimited companies.</p>

<p>Legal change depends on financial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
upheavals and human desires. The
desire to found a family and to buy a
big estate is deeply ingrained in Great
Britain. The old aristocracy may go
and a new aristocracy may arise. But
it may well be doubted if any new race
of landowners will, under the new
conditions of being mulcted at every
turn during life and after death, be
able to do for the countryside what
the old type of Squire did for his
tenants—especially in times of agricultural
depression—or show anything
like the same personal interest in the
cultivation of the land.</p>

<p>The best development which is at
all likely to occur is the growth of an
agricultural system on Danish lines,
and this would certainly simplify the
land laws.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII<br>
<small>COSTS AND FUSION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>A friend of mine once remarked to
me that the rich never legislate for the
poor but always for the rich, to which
I retorted that the poor never legislate
for the poor but always for the rich.
The Labour Party is ready enough to
attack any wealth which no longer
exists, such as the so-called wealth of
rural land-owners, but will never attack
a really bloated Trust such as an
international industrial company; nor
are they ever likely to make such an
attack. (I took care to satisfy myself
on this point before buying shares in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
one such company.) It is therefore improbable
that even should the Labour
Party obtain permanent power it will
ever try to make law cheap for the
poor; and the only men and women
who have ever taken any steps in this
direction are the few who realize that
the pillars of society repose upon a
belief in equal justice for all.</p>

<p>I fear that I can see no prospect for
at least fifty years of law costs being
reduced either for the rich or for the
poor. So far as the rich are concerned,
one might suppose that they would
insist upon the law being codified into
some degree of simplicity so that two
citizens might be able to arrive at
their legal rights by successive postcards
referring to different sections of
the code. That is the Utopian ideal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
once expounded to me by Mr. H. G.
Wells; but as years go on it becomes
more and more remote. Popular government
leads to the endless complication
of statutes; and even if these
statutes were intelligible, the increasing
power of bureaucrats to make rules
for themselves becomes more and
more profitable for the lawyers.</p>

<p>I presume that one day the poor man
will be allowed to obtain justice within
reasonable distance of his home. It is
remarkable that a large number of
muddle-headed persons who wish to
subsidize not only the poor man but
also his childless widow and any number
of children whom he may wish
to procreate, have never understood
that he might like also to obtain
justice, especially in the matter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
domestic relations. Poor persons
ought certainly to have as good a
chance of obtaining a divorce as they
have of being married, and also to
have a chance of defending vexatious
proceedings on the part of either
spouse. It is monstrous that husbands
should be treated as they are now in
the police courts, and arrested for arrears
of maintenance as soon as they
have finished a term of imprisonment
which in most cases they would never
have incurred but for a deep conviction
of injustice.</p>

<p>If the community ever becomes
sufficiently enlightened to provide
justice for the poor, I think that they
will probably adopt the American
example of what are called Courts of
Domestic Relations. The Secretary of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
the Divorce Law Reform Union has
received some interesting communications
on these courts from Judge
Lindsey in Denver and Judge Hoffman
in Cincinnati. Judge Lindsey’s
testimony is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am confident, after twenty-three
years as a Judge of a Domestic Relations
Court in America—where I granted
thousands of divorces and heard other
thousands of separation and non-support
cases and controversies between parents
over their children—that a liberal divorce
law contributes to morality, decency, and,
in the end, the strength of the home; but
I shall probably have to write a book,
based on my experiences, to prove it.
A short article or interview is capable of
so many misunderstandings and misinterpretations,
even though it be not
wilfully done.</p>

<p>“The fact that in some western cities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
we have a great many divorces does not
mean an increase in immorality, or even
an increase in the breaking up of homes.
It is often the very best thing that could
happen. Of course, it is our policy in
this Court to get discordant couples
together where we can; but there are
some cases where we would consider it
nothing short of a crime to try to get them
together, and on the contrary try to get
them apart, but all in the interest of
morality and decency.</p>

<p>“I am judge at this time of what is
known as a separate, special Court, in a
city of nearly 300,000 people in one of
our western cities (Denver, Colorado).
The State has a population of about a
million people; but my jurisdiction is
limited to its capital city, which has
nearly one-third of the population of the
entire State. The western part of the
State is very mountainous and sparsely
settled; the eastern part is mostly arid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
country and at present without irrigation,
being also sparsely settled; but there are
certain sections of the State which are
very good for agriculture and others rich
in mineral resources; and as a commercial
centre, Denver is a delightful and beautiful
city, made up of the best people in the
world.</p>

<p>“Last year we had in this city about
3,000 marriage licenses, and about 1,500
applications for divorce, with perhaps not
over 1,000 of them granted. We have a
city of excellent homes and exceptional
laws for the protection of children, and
the morality of our people is equal to
that of the very best.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that we have not as yet
completed the contemplated report of
this Court, which we expect to have
printed. I am hoping to have it ready in
about six or eight months, and I think it
will be a volume that will greatly interest
your readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>“This Court has jurisdiction over all
children’s cases, and all youths under
twenty-one, all cases of non-support or
desertion of wives or children, and of
controversies of parents over their children,
and practically all criminal cases
where the accused has committed an
offense against a child. Thus, it is a
special tribunal for the <em>correction</em> and
<em>protection</em> of children and some cases of
domestic relations. We do not now have
the divorce cases proper, although I tried
them for seven or eight years exclusively.
The reason for this is that happily most of
those cases are between couples who have
no children, and the divorce cases take up
too much time from the more important
work dealing with children’s cases.
However, in a divorce case where there is
a controversy between husband and wife
over the custody of a child, it may be
heard, and frequently is heard, in this
Court. A Bill is now before the Legislature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
which will practically require the
hearing of most of these cases in this
Court.</p>

<p>“We have visitation and probation
officers, medical clinics, physical and
psychological, which aid and assist us.
The work of this Court, in a word, is
more that of a place of human adjustment—adjustment
of human difficulties growing
out of the relation of the sexes, married
or unmarried. To my mind this is
the most important kind of a tribunal
and ought to exist in, say, ten or fifteen
districts in London instead of the system
you have of dividing the work into many
courts where none of them are equipped
as experts. An address which I delivered
nearly ten years ago still covers a great
deal of my ideas on the ideal tribunal of
this kind.</p>

<p>“The budget of this Court for all its
work in its various divisions, last year,
was about $30,000. I believe with you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
that would be about £5,000 or £6,000.
This includes the salaries of the judge,
the clerks, probation officers, stenographers,
visitation agents, specialists, etc.
We heard and disposed of about 3,000
cases last year at an expense of about
$10.00 per case (about £2). Perhaps in
half of the cases of domestic difficulties
we were able to bring about an amicable
settlement and restore the relations in the
home. In perhaps twenty-five per cent.
of them we were quite agreed that no
effort should be made to restore such
relations unless we wished to contribute
to crime and immorality. Of course, in
most of such cases the old church view
would be to persuade the people to live
together in a state of what to us is sin and
crime, but with the church is considered
perfectly proper.</p>

<p>“When we have to send a youth to the
State prison, jail or reformatory, we send
him by himself on trust and honour,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
without an officer and without official
restraint. Out of some eight hundred
thus committed in the last twenty years,
we have never lost a prisoner.</p>

<p>“We very seldom swear a witness in
the Court, and seldom take testimony.
The cases are tried by what we call the
administrative method. For example,
the wife will consult with me one day,
the husband the next, and then both
together. I could see a witness for either
side at any time. We listen to anyone
who wants to talk, so long as they do not
all talk at once. We have no rules of
evidence and no Court costs, and, as a
rule, no lawyers’ or counsel or solicitors’
fees. The judge of this Court is a human
adjuster of human difficulties without
cost or expense to the parties
involved.</p>

<p>“Most of the people involved in sex
cases come here voluntarily, even though
the cases may involve criminal offences.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
People never lie to us, although it is very
rare that they are ever sworn to tell the
truth. In most cases their own papers are
prepared by the clerks of the Court for
both sides, without the need or aid of
lawyers or solicitors. I should say that
in not over one case in fifty does any
lawyer ever appear. Of course, if they
wish to appear they have a right to, but,
as a rule, litigants do not want them
because they do not need them. In the
saving of counsel, solicitors’, and Court
fees for litigants, many thousands of
dollars have been saved, and other
financial savings during my administration
have amounted to millions of dollars,
as can be shown by the records. There
is, perhaps, not an “exception” or an
appeal—though that right is allowed—in
one case out of five thousand in this
Court. In other words, it is a Court of
justice without any of the hampering
hobbles that make for perjury and crime<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
in other courts, as we have found from
actual experience.”</p>
</div>

<p>Judge Hoffman writes as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It being fairly well conceded by
scientific social workers that delinquency
of children, divorce, desertion, and adult
criminality are inter-related and in great
measure originate in the family, it was
determined in 1914 in the City of Cincinnati
to organize a court that might
deal with the family situation as a whole;
consequently, in that year the Legislature
of the State of Ohio provided such a court
for Hamilton County, in which the City
of Cincinnati is located.</p>

<p>“Hamilton County has nine Nisi Prius
Judges, designated in our State as the
Judges of the Court of Common Pleas.
The law stipulated that at the next election
of the Judges of the Court of Common
Pleas one should be designated on the
ballot as Judge of the Court of Common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations,
and to the judge so elected, the judges in
joint session should assign all divorce and
alimony cases, all cases of desertion and
all cases arising under the Juvenile Court
Act, which includes contributing to
delinquency and dependency. As the
Juvenile Court administers mothers’ pensions,
this also comes under the jurisdiction
of the so-called Court of Domestic
Relations or, as it is termed in this city,
Family Court.</p>

<p>“The purpose of the Court was that of
securing more efficient handling of the
problems of an anti-social character that
arise in the family, and also of ascertaining,
if possible, the causes of family dissension
and disruption. While the law
does not so provide, yet we have been able
to organize a psychological and psychiatric
clinic in connection with the court.
The clinic now has three psychologists
and a psychiatrist; in addition thereto, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
physician for the purpose of making
physical examinations of girls.</p>

<p>“The Juvenile Court procedure has all
but disappeared. We do not believe that
a court procedure has any therapeutic
value in the handling of children afflicted
with that which we term the disease of
delinquency. It has been found possible
for us to prevent the sending of children
to the industrial schools, reformatories, or
correctional institutes of any character.</p>

<p>“In this State we have an industrial
school that now has a population of
1,200 boys. Cincinnati has a population
of 500,000 and is the second largest city
in the State. Notwithstanding this fact
we have but two boys in the industrial
school at this time and these two have
been committed to that institution only
because we have found them to be incurable
and there is no other institution
in the State that is equipped to handle
cases of this kind. We hope to remedy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
this defect at an early date. We have
sent no girls to the State industrial school
for three years last past.</p>

<p>“It is a well-established fact that the
anti-social behaviour at the basis of
divorce is exceedingly injurious to children;
therefore we use our probation
force in the divorce division and attempt
to care for the children involved.</p>

<p>“We have a central record system in
which the history of the whole family is
recorded. We find that in 30 per cent. of
the divorce cases the family has previously
appeared in some way in the Juvenile
Division. The significance of this fact
is apparent.</p>

<p>“We have found, too, that the grounds
for divorce mentioned in the petition or
complaint are but descriptive of the
symptoms of the real causes that are
seldom, if ever, mentioned in the petition
or appear in the evidence. In fact, so far
as the court procedure is concerned, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
real causes would never be revealed.
We made an intensive pathological investigation
and examination in about
1,400 cases. The facts revealed in these
examinations are of such a nature as to
utterly refute the doctrine that in no instance
ought a divorce to be granted or
that a party should be prevented from
obtaining a legal relief by a restricted
divorce law or by making the divorce
procedure so costly as to prevent the
party from obtaining any relief under it.”</p>
</div>

<p>There are also certain other points
which may one day be settled in order
to give justice to the poor. One of
them is the question of costs for an
innocent person arrested on a criminal
charge. It seems to me only right that
if the prosecution fails the prisoner
should have a right to obtain costs
against the Crown even if he is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
allowed the right of suing the Crown
for damages for malicious prosecution,
which, I think, should exist just as
much as in the case of malicious
prosecution by a private individual.
In regard to murder, the prisoner has
the special advantage of being able to
give exclusive rights to some particular
newspaper in consideration of the
newspaper financing his defence; but
in so far as this leads to a disproportionate
amount of limelight being
thrown by the said newspaper on the
private life of the family history of
the criminal, it tends to have a demoralizing
effect. This advantage is at
any rate denied to the ordinary poor
man who is wrongfully arrested on
some minor and scandalous charge,
and the situation to-day is enormously
aggravated by the employment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
narks or decoys in mufti by the police.</p>

<p>I imagine that many of these reforms
will be carried out by the Ministry of
Justice which was so ardently advocated
by the late Mr. Samuel Garrett as a
substitute for the overworked Lord
Chancellors of our day. But perhaps I
need hardly recapitulate here the arguments
for such a ministry which are set
out in my book <cite>Concerning Solicitors</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Published by Chatto &amp; Windus.</p>

</div>

<p>Personally I believe that justice for
the poor can be and will be achieved
mainly on the Scottish system, which
provides a rota of counsel and solicitors
for poor persons in both civil and
criminal matters. Many publicists, the
most eminent of whom is perhaps
Walter Bagehot, have imagined that
cheap law could be achieved by what
is called the fusion of solicitors and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
barristers. I gravely doubt whether
this process will ever take place in
Great Britain, or whether, if it did, it
would have many of the advantages
which have been attributed to it. Some
years ago I took the trouble to make
some enquiry into the matter, and I obtained
expert opinion in regard to the
Colonial and American system, under
which fusion has been established. It
works fairly well in the higher courts
of sparsely populated colonies, for
there the need for specialization is not
so acutely felt as in big cities, where
more money is usually at stake and
where the solicitor has much more work
to do in his own office. On the other
hand, even where fusion exists, it does
not abolish the essential division of
labour in regard to preparing a case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
for hearing and expounding the case in
court. The information which I obtained
resulted in the following conclusion:—(1)
Fusion would not tend to
make law any cheaper in Great Britain
and it certainly does not make law any
cheaper in the Colonies or in the United
States. (2) Fusion would not mean
greater despatch in dealing with business.
(3) The client would not obtain
better advice, because where fusion
exists the firm of lawyers whom he
consults prefer the opinion of a partner
to that of a specialist in another firm.</p>

<p>We may possibly see the lay client
enabled to consult counsel direct where
litigation is not concerned and the
solicitor’s right of audience in the
High Court slightly extended.</p>

<small>PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW</small></h2>
</div>


<p>In a previous chapter I pointed out
that our Commercial Court practice
was not tending to the creation of international
Courts; but some merchants
are entering into international
arbitration agreements to the exclusion
of their national courts and it is said
that these work well, though they involve
more delay. The progressive
creation of public international tribunals
may encourage the growth of
similar tribunals for settling private
disputes; but the principal outstanding
obstacle to international agreement on
questions of status and property is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
conflict between the tests of nationality
and domicil.</p>

<p>In the British Empire we have at
last achieved an Imperial Nationality
and alongside of it exists a local
nationality which will vary according
to the laws of each colony, which prescribe
different periods of residence.
If this movement for uniformity continues
it may have great results. Nationality
at present concerns a man’s
property very little—in the United
Kingdom not at all except as regards
the capacity of owning ships. It gives
certain political privileges; but the law
affecting marriage property and contracts
has nothing to do with nationality,
and in this respect it differs
sharply from the laws of continental
nations. A contract according to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
English law (whether for sale or
marriage) is good if valid according to
the laws of the country in which it is
drawn up and made. Personal or
“movable” property is dealt with according
to the law of a man’s domicil
(except in the cases of bankruptcy or
liability to income tax which turn upon
residence), and although a marriage
contract is good in England, whatever
the domicil of the parties, it cannot
be dissolved except in accordance with
the law of the country which is the
husband’s domicil. (Land is dealt with
according to the law of the country in
which it is situate.) Clearly, therefore,
the domicil is the most important test
of all the English-speaking world, yet
it is of all tests the most uncertain.
The late Professor Dicey, in his last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
edition of the Conflict of Laws, admits
the extraordinary difficulties surrounding
the subject, especially in the case of
what is called “Anglo-Indian domicil”
and the possibility of determining the
intention of the person whose domicil
is called in question, for domicil depends
entirely on (1) residence and
(2) the intention to remain in the place
of residence. In many cases it may be
said that a person’s domicil cannot be
decided till he dies, and even then
perhaps not with certainty.</p>

<p>The doctrine of domicil grew up
under the Roman Empire, which comprised
many local systems of law, but
only one citizenship. It became an essential
doctrine of English law and is
common to the English-speaking world
except where the test of residence alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
has been substituted, <i>e.g.</i>, for divorce
jurisdiction in the United States, formerly
in India, and in one or two of
the Colonies, <i>e.g.</i>, New South Wales.
In these cases a conflict of laws at once
arises between the tests of residence
and domicil, so that, <i>e.g.</i>, a wife who
obtains a divorce in New South Wales
finds that it is not recognized in England
if the husband has an English domicil.</p>

<p>A different conflict arises between
the laws of almost all continental
countries and the laws of English-speaking
countries, because the continental
jurists have adopted the tests
of nationality instead of domicil. Anyone
acquainted with the doctrine of the
<i lang="fr">renvoi</i> and with the liability to double
death duties and general uncertainty
of status in connection with marriage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
divorce, and legitimacy resulting from
this conflict must certainly agree that
the present system is anomalous and
defective.</p>

<p>The best solution of these difficulties
would be:—</p>

<p>(1) To establish an uniform nationality
for the Empire coupled with the
test of residence in regard to local
laws, such as we should see in the
United States if the Americans adopted
residence instead of domicil as the test
in every State, and</p>

<p>(2) To substitute an uniform test of
residence for domicil while safeguarding
certain convenient doctrines by
international, as well as imperial,
convention.</p>

<p>It is, for instance, highly undesirable
for a Frenchman to carry about with him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
an incapacity to marry under 25 without
parental consent wherever he goes. If
he marries an Englishwoman in England
the French Courts must be induced
to admit that the marriage contract is
good if celebrated according to English
law. This also applies to Italy.</p>

<p>Again there is an obvious convenience
in the old rule that land must be dealt
with according to the law of the country
where it is situate, and personal
property according to the law of the
domicil (or, as I should prefer to have
it, the law of the local nationality).</p>

<p>It is anomalous that a colony like
British Columbia should exact death
duties on shares held in an industrial
company trading in Vancouver by a
deceased Englishman domiciled in
England. A special order in Council<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
enables the executors of the Englishman
to recover the estate duty they
have to pay on such shares before the
will can be proved; but it does not relieve
them from the nuisance of filling
up forms to supply a vast quantity of
absurd and irrelevant information
compared with which the famous
Form 4 was positively pleasurable.</p>

<p>To establish the test of nationality
would at once sweep away most of the
worst cases of conflict between our own
test of domicil and the continental test
of residence. There would be comparatively
little confusion as to what law
should be applied in most cases. If an
Englishman died in France his Imperial
nationality would at once determine
the principle that his status
and property were in no way involved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
in any question of a French domicil,
and his English “local nationality”
acquired either by birth or residence
would determine the rest. This would
entirely fit in with the laws of the
Continent.</p>

<p>The same facilities would make for
uniformity in the marriage laws
throughout the Empire. An Imperial
subject living in, <i>e.g.</i>, the West Indies
or the Channel Islands (where there is
no divorce) would be entitled to obtain
a divorce according to the law of
England or Scotland or any colony in
which divorce existed by, say, five
years’ residence. The period of residence
and nationality are indisputable
facts; the domicil is not. Take, for
example, Scotland. A woman may
divorce her husband in Scotland, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
the Scottish law permits her husband
within 40 years after the decree to go
to the Court and annul the decree on
the ground that his domicil was not, at
the time of the suit, Scottish, although
he may have put in no such defence at
the time. A law which clearly could
not be invoked except after a period
of five years’ continuous residence,
without regard to what the husband’s
intentions were or where he happened
to own houses or land, makes for order
where the present law produces chaos.
Under my system the husband will no
longer be able to say, “I had property
in Scotland, but I did not often reside
there; I have now decided to let it,
and my present intention is to die in
Timbuctoo.”</p>

<p>The test of residence would also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
solve the difficulties of a wife living
apart from her husband because she
might be allowed to acquire the right
of invoking the laws of the country in
which she resides, as she can to-day in
England when she asks under the old
ecclesiastical rule for a judicial separation
or nullity of marriage, and this
right would be recognized throughout
the Empire.</p>

<p>Every day the tests of nationality
and residence are gaining ground.
Every day the test of domicil gives
rise to more complicated disputes.
Unless we mend our ways in time, the
present confusion will become rapidly
worse confounded.</p>

<p>I venture to think that a reform
which so obviously appeals to the common
sense of mankind must arrive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
within at least fifty years. It involves
rather less hard work than the Birkenhead
Statutes about real property.</p>

<p>There are many persons to-day who
either have a double nationality or no
nationality; but these anomalies are
for the most part due to the absence of
international agreement owing to the
gulf set up by the conflict of domicil
and nationality.</p>

<small>INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>In other books I have shown how
individual liberty originated with the
Stoic philosophy and was developed
under the Christian religion and
through the feudal system of medieval
Europe. It was fostered by Humanism;
it was idealized by Puritans like Milton
in the seventeenth century and by the
English writers and philosophers of
the eighteenth century. It was still
further expanded by men like Jeremy
Bentham and John Stuart Mill in the
nineteenth century. From 1880 onwards,
the Collectivist Germanophil
tendencies which Mr. Belloc has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
grouped together under the general
description of “The Servile State,” has
led to a contempt for human liberty
due to the multiplication of propertyless
wage-earners living in huge cities
and divorced from the property-loving
existence of the yeoman and peasant.
This development goes back to the industrial
revolution. Democracy values
equality more than liberty, and the
Great War destroyed many individual
privileges which have not yet been restored.
Modern Puritanism similarly
reinforces the effort to impose on the
Community a rigidly standardized existence
with no outlet for individual
preferences in architecture or food or
drink. Every hour must be of the same
pattern and everyone must do everything
at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>The increasing Americanization of
Great Britain may well breed despair in
anyone who wishes to see the ideals of
the aristocrat, the humanist, and the
peasant preserved by law. It may be
that the last refuge of liberty will be
found in the Catholic Church, which was
the only religious body with sufficient
courage to resist Prohibition in the
United States, and that the Common
Law of England, inspired throughout
by traditions of freedom, will be gradually
extinguished by a multitude of
pettifogging Statutes, each destroying
piecemeal some little vestige of a period
when a man could call his soul his own.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, only one reassuring
sign of the times, which is that the
lawyers both here and across the
Atlantic have as yet shown no disposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
to repudiate the traditions of
English jurisprudence and efforts to
increase the right of search in private
houses (as in the case of the Wireless
Bill) have been stubbornly resisted
in Parliament on this side of
the Atlantic.</p>

<p>We stand, perhaps, at the parting of
the ways and it is difficult to discern
whether the old alliance of law and
liberty will endure; but it is to be
hoped that the ordinary citizen will
take to heart the obvious truth that if
liberty cannot exist without law, law
equally depends on liberty based on
responsibility, for any law which
weakens or destroys liberty breeds
anarchy. Recent history has confirmed
this platitude both in Russia and in the
United States of America, so perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
we may hope for the best while not
abating any vigilance. There are, however,
most disquieting signs in Great
Britain of gross tyranny exerted by
our new bureaucracy against taxpayers
and by the police against young men
and women—verging on blackmail in
certain cases. The Victorian ideal of
liberty is dead and no other ideal has
yet come to life. “<span lang="la">Quis custodiet
